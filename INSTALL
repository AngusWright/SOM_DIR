# Installation script for the SOM_DIR repo
#

The SOM_DIR repository houses primarily the DIR_som.R script, 
which can be run directly from the command line given a functional 
R installation. 

The script automatically searches for, and installs, the required 
R dependencies. However, you can also run the installation step by 
running INSTALL.sh
